This version of the Push Swap project operates solely using the LIS (Longest Increasing Subsequence) method. The push-back phase is significantly more efficient and cleaner compared to earlier versions.

In the Chunk method, sorting 100 nodes typically requires between 800 and 950 moves. The LIS + Chunk hybrid method averages around 850 moves.

However, using only the LIS method, the move count is reduced to approximately 650, demonstrating clear improvement.This version of the Push Swap project operates solely using the LIS (Longest Increasing Subsequence) method.
